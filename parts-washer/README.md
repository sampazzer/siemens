## simulating
This explains about simulating HMI and PLC: [manual](https://cache.industry.siemens.com/dl/files/099/109748099/att_998491/v1/109748099_Simulation_of_WinCCTIA_Protal_and_PLCs_en.pdf)

## todo
check trends against a good run (when i rebooted just the hmi it was saying about chamber cooling but i'm not sure if this was just because the hmi was now so out of sync.)
